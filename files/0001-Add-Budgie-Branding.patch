+
+Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
+
+Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
+conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
+original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
+and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
+following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
+exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
+
+     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
+     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
+     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
+     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
+     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
+     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
+     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
+     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
+     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
+     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
+     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
+     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

+
+     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
+     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
+     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
+     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
+     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
+     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
+     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
+     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
+     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
+     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
+     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
+     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
+     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
+     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

+By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
+to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
+Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public
+License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a

+
+  e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
+     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
+     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright

+     agreements.
+

+     License.
+
+  i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
+     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
+     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
+     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
+
+  j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
+     under this Public License.

+     available to the public including in ways that members of the
+     public may access the material from a place and at a time
+     individually chosen by them.
+
+  l. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
+     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
+     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
+     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
+     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
+
+  m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
+     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
+
+
+Section 2 -- Scope.
+
+  a. License grant.
+
+       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
+          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
+          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
+          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
+
+            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
+               in part; and
+
+            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
+
+       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
+          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
+          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
+          its terms and conditions.
+
+       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
+          6(a).
+
+       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
+          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
+          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
+          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
+          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
+          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
+          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
+          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
+          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
+          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
+          (4) never produces Adapted Material.
+
+       5. Downstream recipients.
+
+            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
+               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
+               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
+               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
+               Public License.
+
+            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
+               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
+               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
+               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
+               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
+
+            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
+               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
+               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
+               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
+               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
+               Material.
+
+       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
+          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
+          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
+          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
+          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
+          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
+
+  b. Other rights.
+
+       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
+          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
+          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
+          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
+          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
+          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
+          Rights, but not otherwise.
+
+       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
+          Public License.
+
+       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
+          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
+          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
+          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
+          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
+          reserves any right to collect such royalties.
+
+
+Section 3 -- License Conditions.
+
+Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
+following conditions.
+
+  a. Attribution.
+
+       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
+          form), You must:
+
+            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
+               with the Licensed Material:
+
+                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
+                    Material and any others designated to receive
+                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
+                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
+                    designated);
+
+                ii. a copyright notice;
+
+               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
+
+                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
+                    warranties;
+
+                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
+                    extent reasonably practicable;
+
+            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
+               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
+
+            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
+               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
+               hyperlink to, this Public License.
+
+       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
+          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
+          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
+          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
+          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
+          information.
+
+       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
+          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
+          reasonably practicable.
+
+  b. ShareAlike.
+
+     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
+     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
+
+       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
+          license with the same License Elements, this version or
+          later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.
+
+       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
+          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
+          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
+          context in which You Share Adapted Material.
+
+       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
+          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
+          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
+          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
+
+
+Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
+
+Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
+apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
+
+  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
+     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
+     portion of the contents of the database;
+
+  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
+     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
+     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
+     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
+
+     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
+  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
+     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
+
+For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
+replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
+Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
+
+
+Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
+
+  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
+     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
+     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
+     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
+     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
+     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
+     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
+     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
+     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
+     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
+
+  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
+     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
+     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
+     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
+     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
+     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
+     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
+     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
+     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
+
+  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
+     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
+     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
+     waiver of all liability.
+
+
+Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
+
+  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
+     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
+     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
+     terminate automatically.
+
+  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
+     Section 6(a), it reinstates:
+
+       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
+          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
+          violation; or
+
+       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
+
+     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
+     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
+     of this Public License.
+
+  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
+     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
+     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
+     will not terminate this Public License.
+
+  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
+     License.
+
+
+Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
+
+  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
+     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
+
+  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
+     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
+     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
+
+
+Section 8 -- Interpretation.
+
+  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
+     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
+     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
+     be made without permission under this Public License.
+
+  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
+     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
+     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
+     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
+     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
+     conditions.
+
+  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
+     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
+     Licensor.
+
+  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
+     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
+     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
+     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
